    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 green bell peppers, tops and seeds removed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
        <li>½ cup long grain white rice</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop enough reserved green pepper tops to equal 1/4 cup; set aside. Discard remaining tops or use for another purpose.</li>
        <li>Place hollowed-out green peppers in a microwave-safe dish; cover and cook in microwave until bright green and steaming, about 3 minutes. Set peppers aside.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet with onion and 1/4 cup chopped pepper tops over medium heat until beef is browned, the juices run clear, and the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Pour in diced tomatoes with their juice, rice, water, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover skillet, and simmer until rice is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir Cheddar cheese into ground beef-rice mixture and spoon mixture into precooked peppers. Set peppers upright in an 8x8-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and peppers are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
